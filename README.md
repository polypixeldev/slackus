**The status bot for Slack bots!**

Slackus is a Slack bot to monitor the status of other Slack bots in a workspace. Its versatile system allows almost any bot to be monitored, and features a robust notification system to notify people & channels when a Slack bot is down or back up. Slackus aims to remove the need for the question, "Is \<bot\> down?"
